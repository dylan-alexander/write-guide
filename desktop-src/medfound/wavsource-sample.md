# WavSource Sample

Shows how to create a custom media source in Microsoft Media Foundation. The sample implements a media source that parses .wav audio files.

This sample is a relatively simple example of a media source:

-   There is only one stream, so there is no code to implement stream selection.
-   The media source does not implement rate control (that is, fast forward or reverse playback).
-   All source and stream methods are implemented as synchronous methods.
-   Because the data portion of a .wav file is a single block of uncompressed PCM audio, the media source does not need to read packet headers or otherwise parse the stream during playback, other than reading the initial [**WAVEFORMAT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757712(v=VS.85).aspx) header.

For a more advanced example of a media source, see the [MPEG1Source Sample](mpeg1source-sample.md).

## APIs Demonstrated

This sample demonstrates the following Media Foundation interfaces:

-   [**IMFByteStreamHandler**](/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nn-mfidl-imfbytestreamhandler)
-   [**IMFMediaSource**](/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nn-mfidl-imfmediasource)
-   [**IMFMediaStream**](/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nn-mfidl-imfmediastream)

## Usage

The WavSource sample builds a DLL that is a COM server for both the media source and media source's byte-stream handler. Before using the media source, you must register the DLL.

To use the media source, you can run the [BasicPlayback](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb970475(v=VS.85).aspx). The source resolver will automatically load the media source if you select a .wav file for playback. (If an error occurs, make sure that you successfully registered the WavSource DLL.)

You can also use the TopoEdit tool to build a playback topology that contains the media source. For more information about TopoEdit, see [TopoEdit](topoedit.md).
