## Possible Causes

Direct2D allows an application to specify a desired buffer precision for some operations. For example, the precision used for the imaging pipeline is specified using [**ID2D1DeviceContext::SetRenderingControls**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh404530(v=VS.85).aspx). Hardware Direct2D devices, however, may not support all buffer precisions, depending on their feature level. For example, feature level 9 devices may not support buffer precision options other than 8 bits-per-channel.

## Possible Fixes

For applications which run on hardware, ensure that the all buffer precision specifiers are supported by the hardware’s feature level. Consider using [**ID3D11Device::CheckFormatSupport**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-checkformatsupport) and [**ID3D11Device::CheckFeatureSupport**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-checkfeaturesupport) to gain more information about what formats are supported by the hardware, and to determine what surface precisions will be allowed. For consistent operation with all feature level 9 devices, design a fallback mechanism to avoid high-precision buffers.
