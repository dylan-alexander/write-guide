# D1187: SetTarget Called on Outstanding Dc

[**SetTarget**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh404533(v=VS.85).aspx) was called in between a [**GetDC**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371323(v=VS.85).aspx)/[**ReleaseDC**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371327(v=VS.85).aspx) pair.

## Possible Causes

The application obtained an [**ID2D1GdiInteropRenderTarget**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371321(v=VS.85).aspx) and called its [**GetDC**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371323(v=VS.85).aspx) method, and then called [**Flush**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd316801(v=VS.85).aspx) or [**EndDraw**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh404409(v=VS.85).aspx) before calling [**ReleaseDC**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371327(v=VS.85).aspx).

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application calls [**ReleaseDC**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371327(v=VS.85).aspx) before calling [**Flush**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd316801(v=VS.85).aspx) or [**EndDraw**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh404409(v=VS.85).aspx), and that each call to **ReleaseDC** is matched with a prior call to [**GetDC**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371323(v=VS.85).aspx). Direct2D will not attempt to operate on a GDI target resource if its GDI device context is currently being used by the application.
