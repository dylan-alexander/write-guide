## Possible Causes

This message occurs when Direct2D could not produce a hardware target resource with the parameters specified by the application. A likely cause is that the application requested a hardware target whereby Direct2D must take ownership of allocating the target texture, such as through [**ID2D1Factory::CreateHwndRenderTarget**](/windows/desktop/dd371279(v=vs.85).aspx), and the requested size was too large. Each Direct3D feature level imposes a limit on texture sizing. See [Direct3D feature levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh994923(v=win.10)).

## Possible Fixes

When allocating a target, ensure that the target size does not exceed the maximum size allowed by the feature level. To troubleshoot target allocation problems more finely, consider modifying the application to allocate the target texture itself, and verify the allocation succeeds. To directly use that texture as a target, interoperate it as an [**ID2D1Bitmap**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd371109(v=VS.85).aspx) and use the **ID2D1Bitmap** as the argument to [**ID2D1DeviceContext::SetTarget**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh404533(v=VS.85).aspx).
