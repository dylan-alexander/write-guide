# User Object Attributes

A user object has multiple attributes. This section documents key attributes used by Windows, administrative tools, and the Windows Address Book (WAB). It does not describe all attributes; many attributes are not used for the user object.

Some attributes are stored in the directory, such as [**cn**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-cn), [**nTSecurityDescriptor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-ntsecuritydescriptor), [**objectGUID**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-objectguid), and so on, and replicated to all domain controllers within a domain. A subset of these attributes is also replicated to the global catalog.

Non-replicated attributes are stored on each domain controller, but are not replicated elsewhere, such as [**badPwdCount**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-badpwdcount), [**lastLogon**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-lastlogon), [**lastLogoff**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-lastlogoff), and so on. The non-replicated attributes are attributes that pertain to a particular domain controller. For example, **lastLogon** is the last date and time that the user network logon was validated by the particular domain controller that is returning the property.

A user object also has constructed attributes that are not stored in the directory, but are calculated by the domain controller, such as [**canonicalName**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-canonicalname), [**distinguishedName**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-distinguishedname), [**allowedAttributes**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-allowedattributes), and so on.

Attributes for user objects are classified as:

<dl> <dt>

<span id="Base_Object_Attributes"></span><span id="base_object_attributes"></span><span id="BASE_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES"></span>Base Object Attributes
</dt> <dd>

This category includes attributes required for all directory objects, such as [**objectClass**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-objectclass), [**nTSecurityDescriptor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-ntsecuritydescriptor), and so on.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Naming_Attributes"></span><span id="naming_attributes"></span><span id="NAMING_ATTRIBUTES"></span>Naming Attributes
</dt> <dd>

This category includes attributes used to refer to or identify the object, such as [**distinguishedName**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-distinguishedname), [**objectGUID**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-objectguid), [**objectSID**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-objectsid), and so on. For more information about naming attributes for user objects, see [User Naming Attributes](naming-properties.md).

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Security_Attributes"></span><span id="security_attributes"></span><span id="SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES"></span>Security Attributes
</dt> <dd>

This category includes attributes for logon and access control. For more information about security attributes for user objects, see [User Security Attributes](security-properties.md).

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Address_Book_Attributes"></span><span id="address_book_attributes"></span><span id="ADDRESS_BOOK_ATTRIBUTES"></span>Address Book Attributes
</dt> <dd>

This category includes attributes for email and user data. For more information about address book attributes for user objects, see [User Address Book Attributes](address-book-properties.md).

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Application_Specific_Attributes"></span><span id="application_specific_attributes"></span><span id="APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES"></span>Application Specific Attributes
</dt> <dd>

This category includes user-specific configuration data for specific applications.

</dd> </dl>

For more information about reading and modifying attributes for a user object, see [Reading and Writing Attributes of Objects in Active Directory Domain Services](reading-and-writing-attributes-of-objects-in-active-directory-domain-services.md).

For more information about the User class, including a complete list of the [**mayContain**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-maycontain) and [**mustContain**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-mustcontain) attributes of the class, see [**User**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ADSchema/c-user).

## Setting Passwords

The password for a user cannot be modified directly because this would involve sending an unencrypted password over the network. To set the password for a user, it is necessary to use the [**IADsUser.ChangePassword**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iadsuser-changepassword) or [**IADsUser.SetPassword**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iadsuser-setpassword) method. The **IADsUser.ChangePassword** method is used when the application is allowing the user to change their own password. The **IADsUser.SetPassword** method is used when the application enables an administrator to reset a password.
