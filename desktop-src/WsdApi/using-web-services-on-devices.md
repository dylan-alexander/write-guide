# Using Web Services on Devices

The Microsoft Web Services on Devices API (WSDAPI) supports the implementation of client-controlled devices and services, and device hosts conforming to the [Devices Profile for Web Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=59069) (DPWS). WSDAPI may be used for the development of both client and server (device) implementations.

Whenever possible, use WSDAPI to create a Windows-based WSD client or device host application. Using WSDAPI reduces the complexity of development and saves time. For more information, see [WSD Application Development on Windows](wsd-application-development-on-windows.md) and [WSDAPI Development Tools](wsdapi-development-tools.md).

You can also create WSD devices that do not run Windows and are interoperable with Windows-based WSD clients and device hosts. These devices must meet specific requirements to maintain interoperability. For more information, see [WSD Device Development](wsd-device-development.md).
