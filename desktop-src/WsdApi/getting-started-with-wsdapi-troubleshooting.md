# Getting Started with WSDAPI Troubleshooting

This troubleshooting guide contains a set of [diagnostic procedures](wsdapi-diagnostic-procedures.md) that can be used to help identify the cause of application problems. Once the cause of the problem has been successfully identified, the suggested solutions in the diagnostic procedure can be applied in order to resolve the problem.

There are two ways to determine the diagnostic procedure to use. One way is to go to the troubleshooting page for the type of client to view a step-by-step list of diagnostic procedures to use to troubleshoot the client. The other way is to go to the troubleshooting quick reference below to view summary tables that show common problems with WSDAPI applications and the procedures to use to diagnose the problems.

## Troubleshooting by Type of Client

The following topics show the relevant diagnostic procedures by type of client. These topics also show the message patterns associated with the client type.

-   [Troubleshooting WSDAPI Applications Using Directed Discovery](troubleshooting-applications-using-directed-discovery.md)
-   [Troubleshooting Function Discovery Clients](troubleshooting-function-discovery-clients.md)
-   [Troubleshooting People Near Me/Meetings Near Me](troubleshooting-people-near-me-meetings-near-me.md)
-   [Troubleshooting the Add Printer Wizard](troubleshooting-the-add-printer-wizard.md)
-   [Troubleshooting the Network Explorer](troubleshooting-the-network-explorer.md)
-   [Troubleshooting the Projector Wizard](troubleshooting-the-projector-wizard.md)
-   [Troubleshooting Other WSDAPI Applications](troubleshooting-wsdapi-applications.md)

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

The following tables show some problems that can prevent WSDAPI clients and hosts from seeing each other on the network and from exchanging device metadata. The tables also show the diagnostic procedures to run and the criteria to use to evaluate whether the application suffers from a particular problem.

### Network environment problems

| The firewall blocks Network Discovery traffic.                                                                                                                                                       | [Inspecting Adapter and Firewall Settings](inspecting-adapter-and-firewall-settings.md)                                                                                                                                                         | Enabling the Network Discovery exception on the firewall solves the problem.                                                                                                                      |

| The device does not respond to UDP requests by sending a [ProbeMatches](probematches-message.md) or [ResolveMatches](resolvematches-message.md) message in a timely fashion (less than 4 seconds). | [Inspecting Adapter and Firewall Settings](inspecting-adapter-and-firewall-settings.md)                                                                                                                                                         | Disabling the firewall solves the problem, and a generic host that responds in less than 4 seconds works successfully.                                                                            |
| The security context of the application is incorrect (that is, the client and host do not have adequate permissions on the network).                                                                 | [Using a Generic Host and Client for UDP WS-Discovery](using-a-generic-host-and-client-for-udp-ws-discovery.md) or [Using a Generic Host and Client for HTTP Metadata Exchange](using-a-generic-host-and-client-for-http-metadata-exchange.md) | The device address is not shown in WSD Debug Client output.

| An IPSec policy is blocking messages.                                                                                                                                                                | [Using a Generic Host and Client for UDP WS-Discovery](using-a-generic-host-and-client-for-udp-ws-discovery.md) or [Using a Generic Host and Client for HTTP Metadata Exchange](using-a-generic-host-and-client-for-http-metadata-exchange.md) | The device address is not shown in WSD Debug Client output. The problem is not solved by disabling the firewall. The problem cannot be reproduced on a machine not subject to any IPSec policies. |
