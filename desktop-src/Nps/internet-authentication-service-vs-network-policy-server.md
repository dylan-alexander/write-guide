# Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server

Internet Authentication Service (IAS) was renamed Network Policy Server (NPS).

## Internet Authentication Service

Internet Authentication Service is the Microsoft implementation of a RADIUS server and proxy.

Internet Authentication Service supports two API sets: [Network Policy Server Extensions API](ias-extensions.md) and [Server Data Objects API](server-data-objects.md).

See [TechNet: Internet Authentication Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=100899) for more information on IAS.

## Network Policy Server

Network Policy Server is the Microsoft implementation of a RADIUS server and proxy and it is available on Windows servers starting with Windows Server 2008.

NPS supports the same two API sets as IAS: [Network Policy Server Extensions API](ias-extensions.md) and [Server Data Objects API](server-data-objects.md).

In addition, NPS contains a set of new features that expand the IAS capabilities.
