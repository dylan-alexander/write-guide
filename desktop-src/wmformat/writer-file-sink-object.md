# Writer File Sink Object

The writer file sink object is used when writing Windows Media output to a file.

The writer file sink object is created by the function [**WMCreateWriterFileSink**](/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-wmcreatewriterfilesink), which sets a pointer to an **IWMWriterFileSink** interface. The other interfaces of the writer file sink object can be obtained by calling the **QueryInterface** method.

The following interfaces are supported by the writer file sink object.



| Interface                                          | Description                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**IWMRegisterCallback**](/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmregistercallback) | Enables the application to get status messages from the object.                                                                 |
| [**IWMWriterFileSink**](/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmwriterfilesink)     | Opens a file to which the writer object can write data.                                                                         |
| [**IWMWriterFileSink2**](/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmwriterfilesink2)   | Provides extended management of a file sink object. Inherits all of the methods of **IWMWriterFileSink**.                       |
| [**IWMWriterFileSink3**](/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmwriterfilesink3)   | Provides additional options for writing files. Inherits all of the methods of **IWMWriterFileSink** and **IWMWriterFileSink2**. |
| [**IWMWriterSink**](/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmwritersink)             | Allocates memory, determines whether the sink is operating in real time, and handles several callback functions.                |



 

The following callback interface should be implemented by the application to track the progress of a writer file sink object.



| Interface                                      | Description                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**IWMStatusCallback**](/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback) | Required when status information must be communicated to the host application. |
