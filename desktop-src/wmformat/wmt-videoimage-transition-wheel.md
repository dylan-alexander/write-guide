# WMT\_VIDEOIMAGE\_TRANSITION\_WHEEL

The wheel transition reveals the new image by rotating four lines around a common pivot point, like the spokes of a wheel.

## Parameters

The following table describes the parameters used by this transition and lists the members of the [**WMT\_VIDEOIMAGE\_SAMPLE2**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wmt_videoimage_sample2) structure to which they are assigned.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Center X</td>
<td><strong>fEffectPara0</strong></td>
<td>X-coordinate, relative to the video frame, of the center of the wheel effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Center Y</td>
<td><strong>fEffectPara1</strong></td>
<td>Y-coordinate, relative to the video frame, of the center of the wheel effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Angle</td>
<td><strong>fEffectPara2</strong></td>
<td>Angle of rotation, in degrees, of the spokes of the wheel effect. A value of 0.0 indicates the old image without any of the new image revealed. A value of 90.0 indicates the new image fully revealed.Movement from 0.0 to 90.0 appears as clockwise rotation of the spokes.<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Composition</td>
<td><strong>fEffectPara3</strong></td>
<td>Set to one of the following values:
<ul>
<li>0 - Specifies normal composition, in which the previous image is the background, and the current image is the foreground.</li>
<li>1 - Specifies reversed composition, in which the current image is the background image, and the previous image is the foreground</li>
</ul></td>
