# Ribbon Development Introductory Tutorial

This tutorial and accompanying code samples are intended for C++ developers who develop desktop applications and want to take advantage of the Windows Ribbon framework. The tutorial steps you through adding an empty Ribbon to a small application, adding controls with icons, labels, and other resources to the Ribbon, and then connecting the controls to the existing command infrastructure of the application. You learn how the API maintains separation between control organization and event handling. Finally, the tutorial demonstrates how to specify layouts and resizing behavior to show how the Ribbon adapts and performs at different sizes. When you finish, you will have performed all the steps to add and customize a basic Ribbon application.

The platform updates will be available to all Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 customers through Windows Update. Third-party applications that require [Platform Update for Windows Vista](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=166272) or [Platform Update for Windows Server 2008](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=166272) can have Windows Update detect whether the required updated is installed; if it is not, Windows Update will download and install it in the background.
