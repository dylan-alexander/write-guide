# JetUpdate2 Function


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetUpdate2 Function

The **JetUpdate2** function performs an update operation including inserting a new row into a table or updating an existing row. This function contains a list of *grbit* options that can be set while performing an update. Deleting a table row is performed by calling [JetDelete](gg269315\(v=exchg.10\).md).

**Windows Server 2003:  JetUpdate2** is introduced in Windows Server 2003.

**JetUpdate2** is the final step in performing an insert or an update. The update is begun by calling [JetPrepareUpdate](gg269339\(v=exchg.10\).md) and then by calling [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md) or [JetSetColumns](gg294050\(v=exchg.10\).md) one or more times to set the record state. Finally, **JetUpdate2** is called to complete the update operation. Indexes are updated only by [JetUpdate](gg269288\(v=exchg.10\).md) or **JetUpdate2**, and not during [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md) or [JetSetColumns](gg294050\(v=exchg.10\).md).

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetUpdate2(
      __in          JET_SESID sesid,
      __in          JET_TABLEID tableid,
      __out_opt     void* pvBookmark,
      __in          unsigned long cbBookmark,
      __out_opt     unsigned long* pcbActual,
      __in            const JET_GRBIT grbit
    );
```

### Parameters

*sesid*

The session to use for this call.

*tableid*

The cursor to use for this call.

*pvBookmark*

Pointer to a returned bookmark for an inserted row.

*cbBookmark*

Size of the buffer pointed to by *pvBookmark*.

*pcbActual*

The returned size of the bookmark for the inserted row returned in *pvBookmark*.

*grbit*

A group of bits that contain the options to be used for this call, which include zero or more of the following.

It should not be necessary for most applications.</p></td>

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](gg294092\(v=exchg.10\).md) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](gg269184\(v=exchg.10\).md) and [Error Handling Parameters](gg269173\(v=exchg.10\).md).

On success, the open update operation on the cursor is completed. If an auto-increment column is defined for the table, then this value is set for inserted records. If a version column is defined for the table, then its value is initialized for newly inserted records, or incremented each time a record is replaced. All indexes, including clustered and non-clustered indexes are updated.

On failure, no changes of any kind are made to the database. Before insert and before replace callback functions may have been called, but after insert and after replace callbacks will not have been called, since the latter cannot cause an update to fail. The cursor copy buffer is left in its prepared state, so that the opportunity exists to incrementally correct the problems that caused errors and retry the update operation.

#### Remarks

Record size limitations are enforced by [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md), and not in general by [JetUpdate](gg269288\(v=exchg.10\).md). The only exception is when the JET_bitUpdateCheckESE97Compatibility compatibility flag is being used. In this case, the whole record is checked since an individual [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md) operation that exceeded the limit may be compensated by a subsequent call to [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md).

See the Remarks section in [JetUpdate](gg269288\(v=exchg.10\).md) for more information.
