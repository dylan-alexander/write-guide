# JET_ERRCAT


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JET_ERRCAT

The **JET_ERRCAT** group of constants describes higher-level classifications or categories of errors. This group of constants enables applications to define default treatment for a classification of errors, rather than handling each error case individually. It also ensures that the application does not have to handle new error conditions that are included in existing classifications.

Note: This documentation is based on a preliminary release of the Extensible Storage Engine. This information is subject to change.

The **JET_ERRCAT** constants are arranged in a specific hierarchy of conditions and subconditions, as follows:

|--- Error |--- Operation(al) | |--- Fatal | |--- IO | |--- Resource | |--- Memory | |--- Quota | |--- Disk | |--- Data | |--- Corruption | |--- Inconsistent | |--- Fragmentation | |--- Api |--- Usage |--- State

The following table lists the **JET_ERRCAT** constants and provides a description and recovery information, as applicable.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>JET_errcatFatal 3</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>JET_errcatIO 4</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>JET_errcatResource 5</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>JET_errcatMemory 6</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>JET_errcatQuota 7</p></td>
<td><p>Certain &quot;specialty&quot; resources are in pools of a certain size, making it easier to detect leaks of these resources.</p></td>
<td><p>The application should <strong>Assert()</strong> to detect these issues during development . However, in retail code, the application should treat this as a memory error.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>JET_errcatDisk 8</p></td>
<td><p>Represents an error caused by lack of disk space.</p></td>
<td><p>Retry later to determine whether more disk space is available, or ask the operator to free some disk space.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>JET_errcatCorruption 10</p></td>
<td><p>Represents a corruption issue, which is often permanent without corrective action.</p></td>
<td><p>Restore from backup by using the ESE utilities repair operation (this operation restores only the data that is left/lossy). Also when the recovery(JetInit) method is used, recovery can be performed by allowing data loss (for more information, see <a href="gg269296(v=exchg.10).md">JET_bitReplayIgnoreLostLogs</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>JET_errcatInconsistent 11</p></td>

<td><p>Restore from backup by using the ESE utilities repair operation (which only restores the data that is left/lossy). Also in the case of the <strong>recovery(JetInit)</strong> operation, recovery can be performed by allowing data loss (for more information, see <a href="gg269296(v=exchg.10).md">JET_bitReplayIgnoreLostLogs</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>JET_errcatFragmentation 12</p></td>
<td><p>Represents a class of errors in which some persisted internal resource ran out.</p></td>
<td><p>For database errors, offline defragmentation will fix the problem. For the log files, first recover all attached databases to a clean shutdown, and then delete all the log files and the checkpoint.</p></td>

<td><p>See subcategories.</p></td>
<td><p>See subcategories.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>JET_errcatUsage 14</p></td>
<td><p>Represents a usage error. The client code did not pass the correct arguments to the <strong>JET</strong> API. This error will persist with retry.</p></td>
<td><p>Client code should use the <strong>Assert()</strong> method to ensure that this class of errors is not returned, so issues can be caught during development. In retail, the application should notify the operator about the error.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>JET_errcatState 15</p></td>
<td><p>Represents a class of messages that the API can return to describe the state of the database. For example, the <a href="gg294103(v=exchg.10).md">JetSeek()</a> method might return <strong>JET_errRecordNotFound</strong> when the requested record was not found.</p></td>
<td><p>Varies based on the API.</p></td>
