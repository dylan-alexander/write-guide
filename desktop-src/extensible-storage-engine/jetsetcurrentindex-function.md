# JetSetCurrentIndex Function


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetSetCurrentIndex Function

The **JetSetCurrentIndex** function can be used to set the current index of a cursor. The current index of a cursor defines which records in a table are visible to that cursor and the order in which they appear by selecting the set of index entries to use to expose those records.

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetSetCurrentIndex(
      __in          JET_SESID sesid,
      __in          JET_TABLEID tableid,
      __in_opt      const tchar* szIndexName
    );
```

### Parameters

*sesid*

The session to use for this call.

*tableid*

The cursor to use for this call.

*szIndexName*

The name of the index to be selected for the cursor.

If this parameter is NULL or an empty string then the clustered index will be selected. If a primary index is defined for the table then that index will be selected because it is the same as the clustered index. If no primary index is defined for the table then the sequential index will be selected. The sequential index has no index definition. See [JetCreateIndex](gg294099\(v=exchg.10\).md) for more information.

If *pindexid* is not NULL then the index name will be ignored and the index will be selected by its index ID.

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](gg294092\(v=exchg.10\).md) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](gg269184\(v=exchg.10\).md) and [Error Handling Parameters](gg269173\(v=exchg.10\).md).

On success, the current index of the cursor is set to the requested index. Index entries may now be sought using [JetSeek](gg294103\(v=exchg.10\).md) according to the index definition of the requested index. Index entries may also be enumerated using [JetMove](gg294117\(v=exchg.10\).md) in the order specified by that index definition. The current position of the cursor is either set to the first index entry on the index (JET_bitMoveFirst) or to a specific index entry that is related to the current position of the cursor on the old index (JET_bitNoMove). No change to the database state will occur.

On failure, the current index and current position of the cursor are in an undefined state. No change to the database state will occur.

#### Remarks

If the index ID hint is stale then the API simply fails. There is no fallback to the text name of the index in this case as one might expect. This fallback must be done manually by the caller of the API.
