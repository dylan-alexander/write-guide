# JetUpdate Function


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetUpdate Function

The **JetUpdate** function performs an update operation including inserting a new row into a table or updating an existing row. Deleting a table row is performed by calling [JetDelete](gg269315\(v=exchg.10\).md).

**JetUpdate** is the final step in performing an insert or an update. The update is begun by calling [JetPrepareUpdate](gg269339\(v=exchg.10\).md) and then by calling [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md) or [JetSetColumns](gg294050\(v=exchg.10\).md) one or more times to set the record state. Finally, **JetUpdate** is called to complete the update operation. Indexes are updated only by **JetUpdate** or [JetUpdate2](gg269190\(v=exchg.10\).md), and not during [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md) or [JetSetColumns](gg294050\(v=exchg.10\).md).

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetUpdate(
      __in          JET_SESID sesid,
      __in          JET_TABLEID tableid,
      __out_opt     void* pvBookmark,
      __in          unsigned long cbBookmark,
      __out_opt     unsigned long* pcbActual
    );
```

### Parameters

*sesid*

The session to use for this call.

*tableid*

The cursor to use for this call.

*pvBookmark*

Pointer to a returned bookmark for an inserted row.

*cbBookmark*

Size of the buffer pointed to by *pvBookmark*.

*pcbActual*

The returned size of the bookmark for the inserted row returned in *pvBookmark*.

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](gg294092\(v=exchg.10\).md) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](gg269184\(v=exchg.10\).md) and [Error Handling Parameters](gg269173\(v=exchg.10\).md).

On success, the open update operation on the cursor is completed. If an auto-increment column is defined for the table, then this value is set for inserted records. If a version column is defined for the table, then its value is initialized for newly inserted records, or incremented each time a record is replaced. All indexes, including clustered and non-clustered indexes are updated.

On failure, no changes of any kind are made to the database. Before insert and before replace callback functions may have been called, but after insert and after replace callbacks will not have been called, since the latter cannot cause an update to fail. The cursor copy buffer is left in its prepared state, so that the opportunity exists to incrementally correct the problems that caused errors and retry the update operation.

#### Remarks

Callback functions can be registered to be called before or after insert, and before or after update.

Record size limitations are enforced by [JetSetColumn](gg294137\(v=exchg.10\).md), and not in general by **JetUpdate**.

It is important to understand the impact of performing a large number of update operations inside of a single transaction. Each update to the database must be tracked by the database engine in the version store. The version store holds a live record of all the different versions of each record or index entry in the database that can be seen by all active transactions. These versions are used to support the multi-versioned concurrency control in use by the database engine to support transactions using snapshot isolation. Once the database engine has exhausted the resources used to store these versions then it can no longer accept further changes until some transactions have concluded to allow these resources to be reclaimed. When the engine is in this state, all updates will fail with JET_errVersionStoreOutOfMemory. The resources available to the database engine to store these versions can be controlled using [JetSetSystemParameter](gg294044\(v=exchg.10\).md) with [JET_paramMaxVerPages](gg269201\(v=exchg.10\).md) and [JET_paramGlobalMinVerPages](gg269201\(v=exchg.10\).md).
