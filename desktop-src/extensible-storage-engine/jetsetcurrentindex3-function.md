# JetSetCurrentIndex3 Function


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetSetCurrentIndex3 Function

The **JetSetCurrentIndex3** function is used to set the current index of a cursor. The current index of a cursor defines which records in a table are visible to that cursor and the order in which they appear by selecting the set of index entries to use to expose those records.

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetSetCurrentIndex3(
      __in          JET_SESID sesid,
      __in          JET_TABLEID tableid,
      __in_opt      JET_PCSTR szIndexName,
      __in          JET_GRBIT grbit,
      __in          unsigned long itagSequence
    );
```

### Parameters

*sesid*

The session to use for this call.

*tableid*

The cursor to use for this call.

*szIndexName*

The name of the index to be selected for the cursor.

If this parameter is NULL or an empty string then the clustered index will be selected. If a primary index is defined for the table then that index will be selected because it is the same as the clustered index. If no primary index is defined for the table then the sequential index will be selected. The sequential index has no index definition. See [JetCreateIndex](gg294099\(v=exchg.10\).md) for more information.

If *pindexid* is not NULL then the index name will be ignored and the index will be selected by its index ID.

*grbit*

A group of bits that contain the options to be used for this call, which include zero or more of the following.

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>JET_bitMoveFirst</p></td>
<td><p>This option indicates that the cursor should be positioned on the first entry of the specified index. If the clustered index is being selected (primary index or sequential index) and the current index is a secondary index then JET_bitMoveFirst is assumed. If the current index is being selected then this option is ignored and no change to the cursor position is made.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>JET_bitNoMove</p></td>
<td><p>This option indicates that the cursor should be positioned on the index entry of the new index that corresponds to the record associated with the index entry at the current position of the cursor on the old index.</p>
<p>If the definition for the new index contains at least one multi-valued key column then the destination index entry is ambiguous. In this case, the specified <em>itagSequence</em> is used to select which multi-value of the most significant multi-valued key column is used to position the cursor. It is only necessary to pass a single <em>itagSequence</em> even in the case of multiple multi-valued key columns because the engine only expands all values for the most significant multi-valued key column. See <a href="gg294099(v=exchg.10).md">JetCreateIndex</a> for more details.</p>
<p>If JET_bitMoveFirst is specified then this option is ignored.</p>
<p>If the current index is being selected then this option is ignored and no change to the cursor position is made. When this parameter is not present, its value is presumed to be JET_bitMoveFirst.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


*itagSequence*

Sequence number of the multi-valued column value which will be used to position the cursor on the new index.

This parameter is only used in conjunction with JET_bitNoMove. See the description of this option for more details.

When this parameter is not present or is set to zero, its value is presumed to be 1.

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](gg294092\(v=exchg.10\).md) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](gg269184\(v=exchg.10\).md) and [Error Handling Parameters](gg269173\(v=exchg.10\).md).

On success, the current index of the cursor is set to the requested index. Index entries may now be sought using [JetSeek](gg294103\(v=exchg.10\).md) according to the index definition of the requested index. Index entries may also be enumerated using [JetMove](gg294117\(v=exchg.10\).md) in the order specified by that index definition. The current position of the cursor is either set to the first index entry on the index (JET_bitMoveFirst) or to a specific index entry that is related to the current position of the cursor on the old index (JET_bitNoMove). No change to the database state will occur.

On failure, the current index and current position of the cursor are in an undefined state. No change to the database state will occur.

#### Remarks

If the index ID hint is stale then the API simply fails. There is no fallback to the text name of the index in this case as one might expect. This fallback must be done manually by the caller of the API.
