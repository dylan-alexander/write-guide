# Factoids Common Across Languages

A number of factoids describe input that is common to all language recognizers and need not have different formats for different languages. The following table lists factoids that are common across all languages.

<th>Factoid</th>
<th>Definition</th>
<th>Examples</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Digit</strong></td>
<td>Sets bias for a single digit. The recognizer is biased toward returning only single digits when this factoid is set.<br/></td>
<td>0-9<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Email</strong></td>
<td>Sets bias for an email address.<br/></td>
<td>someone@example.com<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Web</strong></td>
<td>Sets bias for various URL formats.<br/>
<blockquote>
[!Note]<br />
The default settings for the recognizer include the <strong>Web</strong> factoid. Because of this, you may not notice a large difference between the <strong>Web</strong> factoid and the default setting. However, the <strong>Web</strong> factoid does help eliminate spaces between words in a URL.
