# Working with Pictures

This topic describes how to adjust pictures using the [System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.SizeMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/z52775w8(v=VS.90).aspx) property, and how to display pictures in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.

## The SizeMode Property

You can specify how an image fits in the control with the [SizeMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/z52775w8(v=VS.90).aspx) property. The SizeMode property is available in both the Managed Library and in the Automation Library. With SizeMode you can:

-   Resize the control borders to fit an image.
-   Stretch an image to fit the control borders.
-   Center an image within the control borders.
-   Anchor an image to the upper-left area of the control without resizing the image or control (some of the image may not be viewable if you do not resize the image or control).

## Working with Pictures in Visual Studio .NET

To display an image at design time in Visual Studio .NET:

1.  Drag an [InkPicture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Aa514604(v=MSDN.10).aspx) control on a form, or double-click the InkPicture control in the Toolbox.
2.  In the **Properties** window, select the **Image** property, and then click the ellipsis button to open the **Open** dialog box.
3.  If you are looking for a specific file type (for example, .jpg files), select it in the **Files of type** box.
4.  Select the file you want to display.

To clear the picture at design time:

1.  In the **Properties** window, select the **Image** property and right-click the thumbnail image.
2.  Click **Reset**.

The [InkPicture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Aa514604(v=MSDN.10).aspx) control is displayed by default without any borders. You can provide a standard or three-dimensional border using the [BorderStyle](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0s5dy25s(v=VS.90).aspx) property to distinguish the InkPicture box from the rest of the form, even if it contains no image.

You can display an image at run time with the [System.Drawing.Image](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/k7e7b2kd(v=VS.90).aspx) object's [FromFile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e6ytk052(v=VS.90).aspx) method:


```C++
ctlInkPicture.Image = Image.FromFile("c:\myImageFile")
```



You can also include a background image with the inherited [Image](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/k7e7b2kd(v=VS.90).aspx) object's [BackgroundImage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4thk01w9(v=VS.90).aspx) property; however, that image cannot be resized.
