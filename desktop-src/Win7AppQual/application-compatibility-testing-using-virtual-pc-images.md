# Application Compatibility Testing Using Virtual PC Images

To start testing web application compatibility, you need to establish a testing environment. The process to build and configure computers for this task is time-consuming and often costly.

To make compatibility testing easier, you can use the free, prebuilt application compatibility Virtual PC (VPC) images. VPC images are pre-configured hard disk drive images that you can load onto existing computers that are running the [Virtual PC software](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=205018). These images enable you to thoroughly test various versions of Microsoft Windows and Windows Internet Explorer with existing applications in a short amount of time.

The VPC images are available for all currently supported versions of Windows and contain many compatibility testing resources and applications. To find the testing images, see [Internet Explorer Application Compatibility VPC Image](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=205019).
