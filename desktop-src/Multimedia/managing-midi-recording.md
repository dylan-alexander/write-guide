# Managing MIDI Recording

After you open a MIDI device, you can begin recording MIDI data. Windows provides the following functions for managing MIDI recording.



| Value                                      | Meaning                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**midiInAddBuffer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798450(v=VS.85).aspx) | Sends a buffer to the device driver so it can be filled with recorded system-exclusive MIDI data. |
| [**midiInReset**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798461(v=VS.85).aspx)         | Stops MIDI recording and marks all pending buffers as done.                                       |
| [**midiInStart**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798462(v=VS.85).aspx)         | Starts MIDI recording and resets the time stamp to zero.                                          |
| [**midiInStop**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798463(v=VS.85).aspx)           | Stops MIDI recording.                                                                             |



 

To send buffers to the device driver for recording system-exclusive messages, use [**midiInAddBuffer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798450(v=VS.85).aspx). The application is notified as the buffers are filled with system-exclusive recorded data. For more information about the notification techniques, see [Managing MIDI Data Blocks](managing-midi-data-blocks.md).

The [**midiInStart**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798462(v=VS.85).aspx) function begins the recording process. When recording system-exclusive messages, send at least one buffer to the driver before starting recording. To stop recording, use [**midiInStop**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798463(v=VS.85).aspx). Before closing the device by using the [**midiInClose**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798452(v=VS.85).aspx) function, mark any pending data blocks as being done by calling [**midiInReset**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798461(v=VS.85).aspx).

Applications that require time-stamped data use a callback function to receive MIDI data. If your timing requirements are not strict, you can use a window or thread callback. However, you cannot use an event callback to receive MIDI data.

To record system-exclusive messages with applications that do not use stream buffers, you must supply the device driver with buffers. These buffers are specified by using a [**MIDIHDR**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd798449(v=VS.85).aspx) structure.
