# Joystick Position

You can query a joystick for position and button information by using the [**joyGetPos**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757107(v=VS.85).aspx) function. For example, an application can query the joystick for baseline position values. The Joystick Control Panel property sheet uses this technique when calibrating the joystick.

You can also query a joystick or other device that has extended capabilities by using the [**joyGetPosEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757108(v=VS.85).aspx) function.
