# Lists

The list controls provide single-select or multiple-select states for complex audio lines. These controls use the [**MIXERCONTROLDETAILS\_BOOLEAN**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757295(v=VS.85).aspx) structure to retrieve and set control properties. The [**MIXERCONTROLDETAILS\_LISTTEXT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757296(v=VS.85).aspx) structure is also used to retrieve all text descriptions of a multiple-item control. The following table describes the types of list controls.



| Control           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-select     | Restricts the control selection to one item at a time. Unlike the multiplexer control, this control can be used to control more than audio source lines. For example, you could use this control to select a low-pass filter from a list of filters supported by a mixer device. |
| Multiplexer (MUX) | Restricts the line selection to one source line at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Multiple-select   | Allows the user to select multiple items from a list simultaneously. Unlike the mixer control, the multiple-select control can be used to control more than audio source lines.                                                                                                  |
| Mixer             | Allows the user to select source lines from a list simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
