# Installing Custom I/O Procedures

To install an I/O procedure associated with the .ARC filename extension, use the [**mmioInstallIOProc**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757323(v=VS.85).aspx) function as follows:


```C++
mmioInstallIOProc (mmioFOURCC('A', 'R', 'C', ' '), 
    (LPMMIOPROC)lpmmioproc, MMIO_INSTALLPROC); 
```



When you install an I/O procedure using [**mmioInstallIOProc**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757323(v=VS.85).aspx), the procedure remains installed until you remove it. The I/O procedure is used for any file you open as long as the file has the appropriate filename extension.

You can also temporarily install an I/O procedure by using the [**mmioOpen**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757331(v=VS.85).aspx) function. In this case, the I/O procedure is used only with a file opened by using **mmioOpen** and is removed when the file is closed by using the [**mmioClose**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757316(v=VS.85).aspx) function. To specify an I/O procedure when you open a file by using **mmioOpen**, use the *lpmmioinfo* parameter to reference an [**MMIOINFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd757322(v=VS.85).aspx) structure as follows:

1.  Set the **fccIOProc** member to **NULL**.
2.  Set the **pIOProc** member to the procedure-instance address of the I/O procedure.
3.  Set all other members to zero (unless you are opening a memory file, or directly reading or writing to the file I/O buffer).

Be sure to remove any I/O procedures you have installed before you exit your application.
