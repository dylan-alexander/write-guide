# Sorting

For NLS, sorting (also known as "collation") is the arrangement of strings. There are two types of sorting:

-   Linguistic sorting. Arranges strings with similar linguistic characteristics into groups (by sorts).
-   Ordinal (non-linguistic) sorting. Arranges the strings in an ordered sequence.

Sorting uses the NLS string comparison functions, such as [CompareString](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd317759(v=VS.85).aspx) and [**LCMapString**](/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-lcmapstringa), or "wrapper" API functions, such as [lstrcmp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms647488(v=VS.85).aspx), that internally call the NLS string comparison functions.
