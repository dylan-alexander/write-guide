<td>LOCALE_RETURN_GENITIVE_NAMES</td>
<td><strong>Windows 7 and later:</strong> Retrieve the genitive names of months, which are the names used when the month names are combined with other items. For example, in Ukrainian the equivalent of January is written &quot;Січень&quot; when the month is named alone. However, when the month name is used in combination, for example, in a date such as January 5th, 2003, the genitive form of the name is used. For the Ukrainian example, the genitive month name is displayed as &quot;5 січня 2003&quot;. The list of genitive month names begins with January and is semicolon-delimited. If there is no 13th month, use a semicolon in its place at the end of the list.
<blockquote>
[!Note]<br />
Genitive month names do not exist in all languages.

<tr class="even">
<td>LOCALE_RETURN_NUMBER</td>
<td><strong>Windows Me/98, Windows NT 4.0 and later:</strong> Retrieve a number. This constant causes <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoa"><strong>GetLocaleInfo</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoex"><strong>GetLocaleInfoEx</strong></a> to retrieve a value as a number instead of as a string. The buffer that receives the value must be at least the length of a DWORD value. This constant can be combined with any other constant having a name that begins with &quot;LOCALE_I&quot;.</td>
