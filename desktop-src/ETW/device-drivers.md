# Device Drivers

This documentation is for user-mode applications that want to use ETW for event tracing. This documentation is not for device drivers that run in kernel-mode. For those writing device drivers and kernel-mode applications that want to use ETW as a low-impact debugger to troubleshoot timing-related problems, see [Event Tracing for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=94371), [WPP Software Tracing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=94372), and [WMI Event Tracing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=94373) in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for information on instrumenting your driver.
