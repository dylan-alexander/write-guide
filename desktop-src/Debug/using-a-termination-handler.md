# Using a Termination Handler

The following example shows how a termination handler is used to ensure that resources are released when execution of a guarded body of code terminates. In this case, a thread uses the [**EnterCriticalSection**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682608(v=VS.85).aspx) function to wait for ownership of a critical section object. When the thread is finished executing the code that is protected by the critical section, it must call the [**LeaveCriticalSection**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684169(v=VS.85).aspx) function to make the critical section object available to other threads. Using a termination handler guarantees that this will happen. For more information, see [critical section objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682530(v=VS.85).aspx).


```C++
LPTSTR lpBuffer = NULL; 
CRITICAL_SECTION CriticalSection; 

// EnterCriticalSection synchronizes code with other threads. 
EnterCriticalSection(&CriticalSection); 
 
__try 
{ 
    // Perform a task that may cause an exception. 
    lpBuffer = (LPTSTR) LocalAlloc(LPTR, 10); 
    StringCchCopy(lpBuffer, 10, TEXT("Hello"));

    _tprintf(TEXT("%s\n"),lpBuffer); 
    LocalFree(lpBuffer); 
} 
__finally 
{ 
    // LeaveCriticalSection is called even if an exception occurred. 
    LeaveCriticalSection(&CriticalSection); 
}
```
