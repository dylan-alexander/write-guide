# Nonblocking Input/Output

If a socket is in nonblocking mode, any I/O operation must either complete immediately or return the error code WSAEWOULDBLOCK indicating that the operation cannot be finished right away. In the latter case, a mechanism is needed to discover when it is appropriate to try the operation again with the expectation that the operation will succeed. A set of network events has been defined for this purpose. These events can be polled or waited on by using [**WSPSelect**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742289(v=VS.85).aspx), or they can be registered for asynchronous delivery by calling [**WSPAsyncSelect**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742267(v=VS.85).aspx) or [**WSPEventSelect**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742276(v=VS.85).aspx). See [Notification of Network Events](notification-of-network-events-2.md) for more information.
