# Reconnecting and Disconnecting

The default destination may be changed by simply calling [**WSPConnect**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742272(v=VS.85).aspx) again, even if the socket is already connected. Any datagrams queued for receipt are discarded if the new address is different from the address specified in a previous **WSPConnect**.

If the address supplied for the socket is all zeros, the socket will be disconnected — the default remote address will be indeterminate, so [**WSPSend**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742292(v=VS.85).aspx) and [**WSPRecv**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742288(v=VS.85).aspx) calls will return the error code WSAENOTCONN, although [**WSPSendTo**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742291(v=VS.85).aspx) and [**WSPRecvFrom**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742287(v=VS.85).aspx) may still be used.
