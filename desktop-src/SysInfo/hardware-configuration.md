# Hardware Configuration

The hardware configuration functions retrieve information such as processor, hardware profile, and keyboard information.

The [**GetSystemInfo**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724381(v=VS.85).aspx) function retrieves processor and memory information, such as the page size, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) identifier, number and type of processors, application address range, and so on. The [**IsProcessorFeaturePresent**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724482(v=VS.85).aspx) function retrieves information about the floating-point operations and instruction sets supported by the processor.

The [**GetCurrentHwProfile**](/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-getcurrenthwprofilea) function retrieves information about the hardware profile. The hardware profile includes information such as the docking state, globally unique identifier (GUID), and display name for the profile. The [**GetKeyboardType**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getkeyboardtype) function retrieves such information as the type of keyboard and the number of function keys on the current keyboard.
