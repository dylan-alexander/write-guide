# ITSubStream (MSPI)

The [**ITSubStream**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732440(v=VS.85).aspx) interface is available if an MSP is associated with the call and it implements substreams. The methods of this interface allow an application to retrieve information on a substream; to start, pause, or stop the substream; and to select or unselect terminals on a substream.

The [**ITSubStream**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732440(v=VS.85).aspx) interface is implemented by an MSP. Please see **ITSubStream** in the MSP Interface section for details on this interface.
