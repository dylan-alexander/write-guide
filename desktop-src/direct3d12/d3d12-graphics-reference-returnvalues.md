| D3D12\_ERROR\_FILE\_NOT\_FOUND                                           | The file was not found.                                                                                               |
| D3D12\_ERROR\_TOO\_MANY\_UNIQUE\_STATE\_OBJECTS                          | There are too many unique instances of a particular type of state object.                                             |
| D3D12\_ERROR\_TOO\_MANY\_UNIQUE\_VIEW\_OBJECTS                           | There are too many unique instances of a particular type of view object.                                              |
| D3DERR\_INVALIDCALL (replaced with DXGI\_ERROR\_INVALID\_CALL)           | The method call is invalid. For example, a method's parameter may not be a valid pointer.                             |
| D3DERR\_WASSTILLDRAWING (replaced with DXGI\_ERROR\_WAS\_STILL\_DRAWING) | The previous blit operation that is transferring information to or from this surface is incomplete.                   |
| E\_FAIL                                                                  | Attempted to create a device with the debug layer enabled and the layer is not installed.                             |

| E\_OUTOFMEMORY                                                           | Direct3D could not allocate sufficient memory to complete the call.                                                   |
