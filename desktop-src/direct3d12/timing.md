# Timing

This section covers querying timestamps, and calibrating the GPU and CPU timestamp counters.

## Timestamp Frequency

Applications can query the GPU timestamp frequency on a per-command queue basis (refer to the [**ID3D12CommandQueue::GetTimestampFrequency**](/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue-gettimestampfrequency) method).

The returned frequency is measured in Hz (ticks/sec). This API fails (and returns E\_FAIL) if the specified command queue does not support timestamps (see the table in the [Queries](queries.md) section).

## Timestamp Calibration

D3D12 enables applications to correlate results obtained from timestamp queries with results obtained from calling `QueryPerformanceCounter`. This is enabled by the call [**ID3D12CommandQueue::GetClockCalibration**](/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue-getclockcalibration).

[**GetClockCalibration**](/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue-getclockcalibration) samples the GPU timestamp counter for a given command queue and samples the CPU counter via `QueryPerformanceCounter` at nearly the same time. Again this API fails (returning E\_FAIL) if the specified command queue does not support timestamps (see the table in the [Queries](queries.md) section).

Note that GPU and CPU timestamp counters are not necessarily directly related to the clock speed of these processors, but instead work from timestamp ticks.
