The following adapter attribute GUIDs are declared in `dxcore_interface.h`, and are used with the [IDXCoreAdapterFactory::CreateAdapterList](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterfactory-createadapterlist) and [IDXCoreAdapter::IsAttributeSupported](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-isattributesupported) methods. For any given adapter, one or more of the attributes could apply.

| GUID | Value |
|-|-|
| DXCORE_ADAPTER_ATTRIBUTE_D3D11_GRAPHICS. Specifies an adapter that supports being used with the [Direct3D 11](/windows/win32/direct3d11) graphics APIs. No guarantees are made about specific features, nor is a guarantee made that the OS in its current configuration supports these APIs. | 0x8c47866b, 0x7583, 0x450d, 0xf0, 0xf0, 0x6b, 0xad, 0xa8, 0x95, 0xaf, 0x4b |
| DXCORE_ADAPTER_ATTRIBUTE_D3D12_GRAPHICS. Specifies an adapter that supports being used with the [Direct3D 12](/windows/win32/direct3d12) graphics APIs. No guarantees are made about specific features, nor is a guarantee made that the OS in its current configuration supports these APIs. | 0x0c9ece4d, 0x2f6e, 0x4f01, 0x8c, 0x96, 0xe8, 0x9e, 0x33, 0x1b, 0x47, 0xb1 |
