DXCore is an adapter enumeration API for DirectX devices, so some of its facilities overlap with those of [DXGI](/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dx-graphics-dxgi). DXCore is used by Direct3D 12.

This documentation set contains information about programming with DXCore, as well as the DXCore reference.
