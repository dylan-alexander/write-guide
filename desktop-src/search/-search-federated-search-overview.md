# Federated Search in Windows

Windows 7 support for search federation to remote data stores using OpenSearch technologies enables users to access and interact with their remote data from within Windows Explorer.

The following list of topics describe how you can build a web-based data store that can be searched using Windows federated search, and enable rich integration of your remote data sources with Windows Explorer without having to write or deploy any Windows client-side code.
