# Local Security Policy

The local security policy of a system is a set of information about the security of a local computer.

The local security policy information includes the following:

-   The domains trusted to authenticate logon attempts.
-   Which user accounts may access the system and how. For example, interactively, through a network, or as a service.
-   The rights and [*privileges*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly) assigned to accounts.
-   The security auditing policy.

The [*Local Security Authority*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly) (LSA) stores the local policy information in a set of [LSA Policy Objects](lsa-policy-objects.md).
