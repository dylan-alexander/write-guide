# Completion of the Authentication Session

After the authentication session is completed, the authentication service calls the [**RasEapEnd**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa363521(v=VS.85).aspx) function to allow the authentication protocol to deallocate its work buffer. This action is taken regardless of whether authentication was successful. Calling the **RasEapEnd** function guarantees that no further calls are made to the authentication protocol using that particular user or context without first calling [**RasEapBegin**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa363520(v=VS.85).aspx).
