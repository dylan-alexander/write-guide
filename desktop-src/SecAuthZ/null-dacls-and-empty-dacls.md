# Null DACLs and Empty DACLs

If the [*discretionary access control list*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly) (DACL) that belongs to an object's [*security descriptor*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly) is set to **NULL**, a null DACL is created. A null DACL grants full access to any user that requests it; normal security checking is not performed with respect to the object. A null DACL should not be confused with an empty DACL. An empty DACL is a properly allocated and initialized DACL that contains no [*access control entries*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly) (ACEs). An empty DACL grants no access to the object it is assigned to.

For an example of how to create a DACL, see [Creating a DACL](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecBP/creating-a-dacl).
