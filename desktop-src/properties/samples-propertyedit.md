## Description

This sample shows how to use the [Property System](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb776909(v=VS.85).aspx) APIs to read and write property values for file types that use the .jpg, .tiff, .doc, .mp3, or .wma extensions, or for file types that have property handlers, such as the [Recipe Property Handler Sample](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Dd940375(v=VS.85).aspx).
