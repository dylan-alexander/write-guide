The width and height of the drag rectangle are specified by the **SM\_CXDRAG** and **SM\_CYDRAG** values returned by the [**GetSystemMetrics**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getsystemmetrics) function.<br/>                                                                                                                                                               |

Only one window at a time can capture the mouse; this window receives mouse input whether or not the cursor is within its borders. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [**GetDoubleClickTime**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646258(v=VS.85).aspx)          | Retrieves the current double-click time for the mouse. A double-click is a series of two clicks of the mouse button, the second occurring within a specified time after the first. The double-click time is the maximum number of milliseconds that may occur between the first and second click of a double-click. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

A window that has captured the mouse receives all mouse input, regardless of the position of the cursor, except when a mouse button is clicked while the cursor hot spot is in the window of another thread. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

[**SetCapture**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646262(v=VS.85).aspx) captures mouse input either when the mouse is over the capturing window, or when the mouse button was pressed while the mouse was over the capturing window and the button is still down. Only one window at a time can capture the mouse.<br/> If the mouse cursor is over a window created by another thread, the system will direct mouse input to the specified window only if a mouse button is down.<br/> |
| [**SetDoubleClickTime**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646263(v=VS.85).aspx)          | Sets the double-click time for the mouse.

The double-click time is the maximum number of milliseconds that may occur between the first and second clicks of a double-click. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
