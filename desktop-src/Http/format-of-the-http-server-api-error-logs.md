# Format of the HTTP Server API Error Logs

In general, HTTP Server API error log files have the same format as W3C error logs except that HTTP Server API error log files do not contain column headings. Each line of an HTTP Server API error log records one error with fields in a specific order. Each field is separated from the preceding field by a single space character (0x0020). Within each field, space characters, tabs, and unprintable control characters are replaced by plus signs (0x002B).

The following table identifies the fields and the order of the fields in an error log record.



<table>

<tr class="odd">

<td>The Date field follows the W3C format and is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).The Date field is always 10 characters in the form of &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;. For example, May 1, 2003 is expressed as &quot;2003-05-01&quot;.<br/></td>
