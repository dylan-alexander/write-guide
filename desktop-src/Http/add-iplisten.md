# add iplisten

Specifies an IPv4 or IPv6 address to be added to the IP listen list.

``` syntax
add iplisten [ address=] IPAddress
 
```

## Parameters

</dt> <dd>

Specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 address to be added to the IP listen list.

</dd> </dl>

## Remarks

## Examples

**add iplisten address=fe80::1**

**add iplisten address=1.1.1.1**

**add iplisten address=0.0.0.0**

**add iplisten address=::**
