# SSP/APs vs. SSPs

[*Security packages*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) are deployed in one of the following types of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs):

-   [SSP/APs](#sspaps-vs-ssps)
-   [SSPs](#sspaps-vs-ssps)

Whether a security package is in a security support provider/[*authentication package*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721532(v=VS.85).aspx) (SSP/AP) or a [*security support provider*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) (SSP) DLL is determined by the types of security services it provides and the extent to which it requires integration with the [*Local Security Authority*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721592(v=VS.85).aspx) (LSA). These differences also determine the API implemented in a custom security package.

## SSP/APs

An SSP/AP is a DLL that contains one or more [*security packages*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) and can function as an SSP for client/server applications and as an [authentication package](authentication-packages.md) for logon applications. To function in both of these roles, SSP/APs are loaded into the LSA process space at system startup and can be loaded into client/server application processes as well.

Custom SSP/AP security packages must implement both the [Functions Implemented by User-mode SSP/APs](authentication-functions.md), and [Functions Implemented by SSP/APs](authentication-functions.md). These function implementations can make use of LSA support functions to offer advanced security features such as token creation, [*supplemental credentials*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) support, and pass-through authentication.

If a custom SSP/AP security package provides the full range of message [*integrity*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721588(v=VS.85).aspx) and privacy functions, it will also implement the [Functions Implemented by User-mode SSP/APs](authentication-functions.md).

## SSPs

An SSP is a DLL that contains one or more security packages that provide authenticated connection, message integrity, and message encryption services to client/server applications. SSPs implement [Security Support Provider Interface](sspi.md) (SSPI) functions. Applications can access the security packages in an SSP by calling the SSPI functions directly. SSPs are loaded into the client and server processes; they are not integrated with the LSA.
