# Relation to Other Services

Other parts of the Microsoft Internet Security Framework use the [*smart card subsystem*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx), as shown in the following illustration. (Because of U.S. export restrictions, a [*cryptographic service provider*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721572(v=VS.85).aspx) (CSP) that uses an SCSP to communicate cryptographic-related requests should sign and verify the SCSP.)
