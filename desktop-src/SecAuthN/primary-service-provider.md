# Primary Service Provider

Each [*smart card*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) known to the system may have a registered COM interface listed as its primary service provider. When you access a *smart card* through COM, this [*primary service provider*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721603(v=VS.85).aspx) supplies the control interfaces to the card. This allows card services to be exposed to a wide range of programming environments, including Java and the Microsoft Visual Basic development system.
