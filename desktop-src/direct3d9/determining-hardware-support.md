# Determining Hardware Support (Direct3D 9)

Direct3D provides the following functions to determine hardware support.

-   [**IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceFormat**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb174309(v=VS.85).aspx)

    Used to verify whether a surface format can be used as a texture, whether a surface format can be used as a texture and a render target, or whether a surface format can be used as a depth-stencil buffer. In addition, this method is used to verify depth buffer format support and depth-stencil buffer format support.

-   [**IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceType**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb174312(v=VS.85).aspx)

    Used to verify a device's ability to perform hardware acceleration, a device's ability to build a swap chain for presentation, or a device's ability to render to the current display format.

-   [**IDirect3D9::CheckDepthStencilMatch**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb174308(v=VS.85).aspx)

    Used to verify whether a depth-stencil buffer format is compatible with a render-target format. Note that before calling this method, the application should call [**IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceFormat**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb174309(v=VS.85).aspx) on both the depth-stencil and render-target formats.
