# Calling UWP APIs from a desktop app

The general rule is that a desktop app can call a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) API. However, some APIs, including the XAML UI APIs, require the calling app to have a package identity. UWP apps have a well-defined app model, and they have a package identity. The other types of desktop apps have neither a well-defined app model, nor a package identity. Therefore, if an API requires a package identity, a WPF, Windows Forms, or Win32 app cannot call it unless the app [is packaged in an MSIX package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-root).

## The DualApiPartition attribute

This is the process to follow whenever there's a particular UWPÂ API that you'd like to call from your desktop app. This process will answer the question of whether the API is allowed to be called from a desktop app. First, visit the [Windows API reference for Windows Runtime apps](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Windows+API+reference+for+Windows+Runtime+apps), find the reference topic for the class or member API you're interested in, and check whether the [**DualApiPartition**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh700630(v=WIN.10).aspx) attribute is listed in the Attributes section.

## If the DualApiPartition attribute is listed

If the DualApiPartition attribute is listed, the API does not need the calling app to have a package identity, and the API is allowed to be called from any desktop app. [**Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geolocator**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/BR225534(v=Win.10).aspx) is an example; an app does not need to be uniquely identified in order to perform location tasks.

## If the DualApiPartition attribute is not listed

If the DualApiPartition attribute is not listed, the API does need the calling app to have a package identity. Therefore a WPF, Windows Forms, or Win32 app is not allowed to call the API unless the app has been converted to a UWP app. [**Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Button**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/BR209265(v=Win.10).aspx) is an example.
