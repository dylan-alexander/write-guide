| [Communications Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevIO/communications-resources)<br/>           | A communications resource is a physical or logical device that provides a single bidirectional, asynchronous data stream. Serial ports, parallel ports, fax machines, and modems are examples of communications resources. For each communications resource, there is a service provider, consisting of a library or driver, that enables applications to access the resource. <br/> |
| [Device Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevIO/device-management)<br/>                         | Device management provides a way to uniformly notify all applications and system components of changes that may affect their operation or access to resources. Applications and the system use and process device events to take advantage of new resources when they become available and to prevent loss of data when existing resources become unavailable. <br/>                 |
| [Enhanced Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/enstor/enhanced-storage-portal)<br/>                  | The Enhanced Storage API enables consistent end-to-end authentication for personal storage devices that differ in form factor. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
