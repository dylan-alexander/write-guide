# Performance Counters Reference

Use the following programming elements to write applications that consume or provide performance counter data:

-   [Performance Counters Functions](performance-counters-functions.md)
-   [Performance Counters Functions for Visual Basic](performance-counters-functions-for-visual-basic.md)
-   [Performance Counters Structures](performance-counters-structures.md)
-   [Performance Counters Enumerations](performance-counter-enumerations.md)
-   [Performance Counters Types](performance-counters-types.md)
-   [Performance Data Helper Error Codes](pdh-error-codes.md)
-   [SQL Log File Schema](sql-log-file-schema.md)

This section also describes:

-   The [schema elements](performance-counters-schema.md) that you use in your manifest to define your performance counters.
-   The [CTRPP](ctrpp.md) tool that parses your manifest and generates the code that defines the layout of the counter data in your provider.
