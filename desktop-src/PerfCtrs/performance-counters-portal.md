# Performance Counters

## Purpose

Counters are used to provide information as to how well the operating system or an application, service, or driver is performing. The counter data can help determine system bottlenecks and fine-tune system and application performance. The operating system, network, and devices provide counter data that an application can consume to provide users with a graphical view of how well the system is performing.

## Where applicable

Use the Performance Counters API when you want to provide or consume counter data.

## Developer audience

Performance Counters is designed for use by C and C++ developers.

## Run-time requirements
