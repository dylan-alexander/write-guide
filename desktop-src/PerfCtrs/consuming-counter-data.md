# Consuming Counter Data

You can consume performance data by using one of the following interfaces:

-   The [Performance Data Helper (PDH) interface](using-the-pdh-functions-to-consume-counter-data.md), which provides high-level access to data from both version 1 and version 2 performance counter providers.
-   The [registry interface](using-the-registry-functions-to-consume-counter-data.md), which provides low-level access to data from performance counter providers.
-   The performance library interface, which provides direct access to data from version 2 performance counter providers.

The PDH interface is easier to use than the registry interface and is recommended for most performance data collection tasks. The PDH interface is essentially a higher-level abstraction of the functionality that the registry interface provides. Use the performance library interface only if you cannot use the PDH abstraction-layer functions.
