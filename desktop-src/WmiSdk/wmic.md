# wmic

The WMI command-line (WMIC) utility provides a command-line interface for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). WMIC is compatible with existing shells and utility commands. The following is a general reference topic for WMIC. For more information and guidelines on how to use WMIC, including additional information on aliases, verbs, switches, and commands, see [Using Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line](https://TechNet.Microsoft.Com/library/cc779482.aspx) and [WMIC - Take Command-line Control over WMI](https://TechNet.Microsoft.Com/library/bb742610.aspx).

## Alias

An alias is a friendly renaming of a class, property, or method that makes WMI easier to use and read. You can determine what aliases are available for WMIC through the **/?** command. You can also determine the aliases for a specific class using the **<className> /?** command. For more information, see [WMIC Aliases](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc736307.aspx).

## Switches

A switch is a WMIC option you can set globally or optionally. For a list of available switches, see [WMIC Switches](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc787035.aspx).

## Verbs

To use verbs in WMIC, enter the alias name followed by the verb. If an alias does not support a verb, you receive the message "provider is not capable of the attempted operation." For more information, see [WMIC Verbs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc784966.aspx).

Most aliases support the following verbs.

<dl> <dt>

<span id="ASSOC"></span><span id="assoc"></span>ASSOC
</dt> <dd>

Returns the result of the `Associators of (<wmi_object>)` query where *<wmi\_object>* is the path of objects returned by the **PATH** or **CLASS** commands. The results are instances associated with the object. When ASSOC is used with an alias, the classes with the class underlying the alias are returned. By default the output is returned in HTML format.

The ASSOC verb has the following switches.



| Switch                         | Description                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /RESULTCLASS:<classname> | Returned endpoints associated with the source object must belong to, or be derived from the specified class.      |
| /RESULTROLE:<rolename>   | Returned endpoints must play a specific role in associations with the source object.                              |
| /ASSOCCLASS:<assocclass> | Returned endpoints must be associated with the source through the specified class, or one of its derived classes. |



 

Example: **OS ASSOC**

</dd> <dt>

<span id="CALL"></span><span id="call"></span>CALL
</dt> <dd>

Executes a method.

Example: **SERVICE WHERE CAPTION='TELNET' CALL STARTSERVICE**

> [!Note]  
> To determine the methods available for a given class, use **/?**. For example, **SERVICE WHERE CAPTION='TELNET' CALL /?** lists the available functions for the service class.

 

</dd> <dt>

<span id="CREATE"></span><span id="create"></span>CREATE
</dt> <dd>

Creates a new instance and sets the property values. CREATE cannot be used to create a new class.

Example: **ENVIRONMENT CREATE NAME="TEMP"; VARIABLEVALUE="NEW"**

</dd> <dt>

<span id="DELETE"></span><span id="delete"></span>DELETE
</dt> <dd>

Deletes the current instance or set of instances. DELETE can be used to delete a class.

Example: **PROCESS WHERE NAME="CALC.EXE" DELETE**

</dd> <dt>

<span id="GET"></span><span id="get"></span>GET
</dt> <dd>

Retrieve specific property values.

GET has the following switches.

| /VALUE                               | Output is formatted with each value listed on a separate line and with the name of the property.                                           |
| /ALL                                 | Output is formatted as a table.                                                                                                            |

Example: **/APPEND:CLIPBOARD**

</dd> <dt>

<span id="_AGGREGATE"></span><span id="_aggregate"></span>/AGGREGATE
</dt> <dd>

Example: **/AGGREGATE:OFF** or **/AGGREGATE:ON**

</dd> </dl>
