# HLSL

HLSL is the High Level Shading Language for DirectX. Using HLSL, you can create C like programmable shaders for the Direct3D [pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-graphics-pipeline).

HLSL was created, starting with DirectX 9, to set up the programmable 3D [pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-graphics-pipeline). You can program the entire pipeline with HLSL instructions.
