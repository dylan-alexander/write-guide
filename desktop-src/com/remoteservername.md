# RemoteServerName

Configures the client to request the object be run at a particular computer whenever an activation function is called for which a [**COSERVERINFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms687322(v=VS.85).aspx) structure is not specified.

## Registry Entry

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID
   {AppID_GUID}
      RemoteServerName = name
```

## Remarks

**RemoteServerName** allows simple configuration management of client applications; they may be written without hard-coded server names and can be configured by modifying the **RemoteServerName** registry values of the classes of objects they use.

As described in the documentation for the [**CLSCTX**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms693716(v=VS.85).aspx) enumeration and the [**COSERVERINFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms687322(v=VS.85).aspx) structure, one of the parameters of the distributed COM activation is a pointer to a **COSERVERINFO** structure. When this value is not **NULL**, the information in the **COSERVERINFO** structure overrides the setting of the **RemoteServerName** key for the function call.
