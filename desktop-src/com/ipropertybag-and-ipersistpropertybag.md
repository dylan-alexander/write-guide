# IPropertyBag and IPersistPropertyBag

[**IPropertyBag**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Aa768196(v=VS.85).aspx) and [**IPersistPropertyBag**](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa768205(v=vs.85)) optimize save as text mechanisms, and therefore are recommended for ActiveX Control containers that implement a save as text mechanism. **IPropertyBag** is implemented by a container, and is roughly analogous to [**IStream**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream). **IPersistPropertyBag** is implemented by controls, and is roughly analogous to [**IPersistStream**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nn-objidl-ipersiststream).
