# Session Keys

[*Session keys*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) are keys that are generated to be used in a single communication session. Session keys are frequently changed and are discarded when they are no longer needed. For example, TLS uses a separate session key for each connection and S/MIME uses a separate session key for each email message. Typically a [*symmetric key*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) is used as the session key.

Session keys are volatile. Applications can save these keys for later use or for transmission to other users. For more information, see [Cryptographic Key Storage and Exchange](cryptographic-key-storage-and-exchange.md).
