# Hardware Cryptography

Certificate Services supports hardware-related cryptography, such as issuing certificates stored on [*smart cards*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx). The enterprise [*certification authority*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721572(v=VS.85).aspx) (CA) supports the issuance of smart card certificates for domain logon on the operating system. Additionally, both the enterprise CA and stand-alone CA support issuance of other types of smart card certificates.

For details, see the product documentation. For developer information about smart cards, see [Smart Card Authentication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa380142(v=VS.85).aspx). For information about the control that allows an administrator to request smart card certificates on behalf of users, see [Smart Card Enrollment Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd627651(v=VS.85).aspx).
