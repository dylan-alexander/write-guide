# Certificate.PrivateKey property

\[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. Instead, use the [**X509Certificate2 Class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Hh424017(v=MSDN.10).aspx) in the [**System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/73091bzx(v=VS.71).aspx) namespace.\]

The **PrivateKey** property sets or retrieves the private key associated with the certificate. This property was introduced in CAPICOM 2.0.

This property is read/write.

## Syntax


```VB
Certificate.PrivateKey As PrivateKey
```



## Property value

A [**PrivateKey**](privatekey.md) object that represents the private key that is associated with the certificate.

## Remarks

Setting the **PrivateKey** property to Nothing removes the association between the private key and the certificate, but it does not delete the private key. To delete the private key, call the [**PrivateKey.Delete**](privatekey-delete.md) method, and then set this property to Nothing.

This property raises CAPICOM\_E\_NOT\_ALLOWED when it is set from a web-based application.
