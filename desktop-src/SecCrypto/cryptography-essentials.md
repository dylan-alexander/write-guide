# Cryptography Essentials

Microsoft CryptoAPI, application programming interface (API), and CAPICOM provide services that enable developers to add security based on [*cryptography*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721572(v=VS.85).aspx) to applications. CryptoAPI includes functionality for encoding to and decoding from [*Abstract Syntax Notation One*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721532(v=VS.85).aspx) (ASN.1), encrypting and decrypting data, authentication using [*digital certificates*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721573(v=VS.85).aspx), and digital certificate management using certificate stores. CryptoAPI and CAPICOM support both PKI and symmetric key cryptography.

Cryptography Essentials contains the following topics:

-   [Cryptography, CryptoAPI, and CAPICOM](cryptography--cryptoapi--and-capicom.md)
-   [Cryptographic Keys](cryptographic-keys.md)
-   [Encoded and Decoded Data](encoded-and-decoded-data.md)
-   [Data Encryption and Decryption](data-encryption-and-decryption.md)
-   [Hashes and Digital Signatures](hashes-and-digital-signatures.md)
-   [Time Stamping Authenticode Signatures](time-stamping-authenticode-signatures.md)
-   [Digital Certificates](digital-certificates.md)
-   [Digital Messages](digital-messages.md)
