# Symmetric Keys

A [*Symmetric key*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) is a single key that is used with the operations of a [*symmetric encryption*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721625(v=VS.85).aspx) scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

The best-known symmetric algorithms are faster than the best-known [*public key algorithms*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721603(v=VS.85).aspx). Thus, they are preferred when processing large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are [*RC4*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721604(v=VS.85).aspx), Triple DES ([*Data Encryption Standard*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721573(v=VS.85).aspx)), and [*Advanced Encryption Standard*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721532(v=VS.85).aspx) (AES).

Because much of the activity involving symmetric keys relates to keeping them secret, it is important to keep the number of people who possess a particular symmetric key as small as possible. We recommend that only one or two people possess any one symmetric key.
