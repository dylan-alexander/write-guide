# How to: Use Source Voice Callbacks

When you create a source voice, you can pass a structure to it that defines callbacks for certain audio events. You can use these callbacks to perform actions or to signal other code.

1.  Create a class that inherits from the [**IXAudio2VoiceCallback**](/windows/desktop/api/xaudio2/nn-xaudio2-ixaudio2voicecallback) interface. All member functions of **IXAudio2VoiceCallback** are purely virtual, and must be defined. The only function of interest in this example is [**OnStreamEnd**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Ee418477(v=VS.85).aspx). Therefore, the rest of the functions are stubs. The **OnStreamEnd** function triggers an event that indicates the sound is done playing.

    ```
    class VoiceCallback : public IXAudio2VoiceCallback
    {
    public:
        HANDLE hBufferEndEvent;
        VoiceCallback(): hBufferEndEvent( CreateEvent( NULL, FALSE, FALSE, NULL ) ){}
        ~VoiceCallback(){ CloseHandle( hBufferEndEvent ); }

        //Called when the voice has just finished playing a contiguous audio stream.
        void OnStreamEnd() { SetEvent( hBufferEndEvent ); }

        //Unused methods are stubs
        void OnVoiceProcessingPassEnd() { }
        void OnVoiceProcessingPassStart(UINT32 SamplesRequired) {    }
        void OnBufferEnd(void * pBufferContext)    { }
        void OnBufferStart(void * pBufferContext) {    }
        void OnLoopEnd(void * pBufferContext) {    }
        void OnVoiceError(void * pBufferContext, HRESULT Error) { }
    };
    ```

    

2.  Create a [**source voice**](/windows/desktop/api/xaudio2/nn-xaudio2-ixaudio2sourcevoice) with [**IXAudio2::CreateSourceVoice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Ee418607(v=VS.85).aspx) using an instance of the callback class created previously as the pCallback parameter.

    ```
    VoiceCallback voiceCallback;
    if( FAILED(hr = pXaudio2->CreateSourceVoice( &pSourceVoice, (WAVEFORMATEX*)&wfx,
                                 0, XAUDIO2_DEFAULT_FREQ_RATIO, &voiceCallback, NULL, NULL ) ) ) return;
    ```

    

3.  After starting the voice, use the [**WaitForSingleObjectEx**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms687036(v=VS.85).aspx) method to wait for the event to be triggered.

    ```
    WaitForSingleObjectEx( voiceCallback.hBufferEndEvent, INFINITE, TRUE );
    ```
