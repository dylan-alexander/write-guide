# Windows Animation Manager

## Purpose

The Windows Animation Manager (Windows Animation) enables rich animation of user interface elements. It is designed to simplify the process of adding animation to an application's user interface and to enable developers to implement animations that are smooth, natural, and interactive.

The animation framework manages the scheduling and execution of animations. It supplies a library of useful mathematical functions for specifying the behavior of a UI element over time, and also enables developers to implement custom functions that provide additional behaviors.

Windows Animation does not perform the rendering; it can be used with any graphics platform, including Direct2D, Direct3D, or GDI+.

## Developer audience

Windows Animation is designed for use by experienced C/C++ developers who are familiar with COM, UI programming concepts, and general animation concepts.

## Run-time requirements

The Windows Animation Manager was introduced in Windows 7.

Applications that require support for Windows Animation Manager on Windows Vista can utilize the Platform Update for Windows Vista. Applications that require Platform Update for Windows Vista can have Windows Update verify that it is installed, or download and install it in the background otherwise. For more information, see [About Platform Update for Windows Vista](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ee663866(v=VS.85).aspx).
