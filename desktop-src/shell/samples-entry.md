# Shell SDK Samples

This section describes the individual Shell samples included in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) and, in most cases, downloadable from the [MSDN Code Gallery](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=154617).

-   [Windows SDK Locations](#windows-sdk-locations)
-   [MSDN Code Gallery Locations](#msdn-code-gallery-locations)
-   [Shell Samples](#shell-samples)

## Windows SDK Locations

When you download and install the WindowsÂ 7 SDK, samples are included in that installation. Use of the default SDK installation path results in the samples being placed under `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Samples\`. Using the default installation path, the Shell samples listed below are found in the following folders:

-   C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0\\Samples\\WinUI\\Shell\\AppPlatform
-   C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0\\Samples\\WinUI\\Shell\\AppShellIntegration
-   C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0\\Samples\\WinUI\\Shell\\LegacySamples
-   C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0\\Samples\\WinUI\\Shell\\ShellExtensibility

## MSDN Code Gallery Locations

Shell samples can also be individually downloaded through the [MSDN Code Gallery](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=154617). Most Shell samples listed below can be found on the following pages:
