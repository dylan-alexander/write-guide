In the case of the Windows SDK, once you have downloaded and installed it, you will find the samples in the installed directory. For example, use of the default installation path for the Windows 7 SDK results in the samples being placed under `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Samples\`.

1.  Open the command prompt window and navigate to the **ExplorerCommandVerb** project directory.
2.  Enter `msbuild ExplorerCommandVerb.sln`.

To build the sample using Microsoft Visual Studio (preferred):

1.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **ExplorerCommandVerb** project directory.
2.  Double-click the icon for the ExplorerCommandVerb.sln file to open the project in Visual Studio.
3.  From the **Build** menu, select **Build Solution**.

## Running the Sample

3.  Two new verbs will be shown on the context menu when you right-click a .txt file.
