## Requirements



| Product                                | Minimum Product Version |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Windows                                | Windows Vista           |
| Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) | 6.1                     |



 

For additional requirements, see the IFileIsInUse\_sample.docx file included with the sample.

## Downloading the Sample

This sample is available in the following locations.



| Location      | Path URL                                                                                             |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code Gallery  | [Windows Shell Application Samples on Code Gallery](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=155655) |
| Windows 7 SDK | [Download Windows 7 SDK](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=129787)                            |



 

In the case of the Windows SDK, once you have downloaded and installed it, you will find the samples in the installed directory. For example, use of the default installation path for the Windows 7 SDK results in the samples being placed under `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Samples\`.

## Building the Sample

To build the sample from the Command Prompt window:

1.  Open the Command Prompt window and navigate to the **FileIsInUse** project directory.
2.  Enter `msbuild FileIsInUse.sln`.

To build the sample using Microsoft Visual Studio (preferred):

1.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **FilesInUse** project directory. For example, the full default installation path is `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Samples\WinUI\Shell\AppPlatform\FileIsInUse`.
2.  Double-click the icon for the FileIsInUseSample.sln file to open the project in Visual Studio.
    > [!Note]  
    > The .sln file name extension is not shown under default folder settings. In that situation, it can be identified by its unique icon or by its type description, "Microsoft Visual Studio Solution".

     

3.  From the **Build** menu, select **Build Solution**.

## Running the Sample

1.  Navigate to the directory that contains the new executable, using the command prompt window or Windows Explorer.
2.  At the command prompt, enter `FileIsInUseSample.exe`, or from Windows Explorer, double-click the icon for FileIsInUseSample.exe.

For detailed information about this code sample, see the IFileIsInUse\_sample.docx file included with the sample.
