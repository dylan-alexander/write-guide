| [Menus](cmd-menus.md)<br/>       | Menus are hierarchical lists of commands or options available to users in the current context.<br/>                                                                                                                          |
| [Ribbons](cmd-ribbons.md)<br/>   | Ribbons are the modern way to help users find, understand, and use commands efficiently and directly with a minimum number of clicks, with less need to resort to trial-and-error, and without having to refer to Help.<br/> |
| [Toolbars](cmd-toolbars.md)<br/> | Toolbars are a way to group commands for efficient access.<br/>                                                                                                                                                              |
