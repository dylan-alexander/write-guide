# DXGI 1.6 improvements

The following functionality has been added to Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) 1.6 in order to detect HDR displays.

## High dynamic range (HDR) detection

The following APIs have been added in order to detect HDR displays.

- [**IDXGIAdapter4**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_6/nn-dxgi1_6-idxgiadapter4)
- [**IDXGIOutput6**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_6/nn-dxgi1_6-idxgioutput6)

Additional fields in [**DXGI\_ADAPTER\_FLAG3**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Mt825227(v=VS.85).aspx) and [**DXGI\_COLOR\_SPACE\_TYPE**](/windows/desktop/api/dxgicommon/ne-dxgicommon-dxgi_color_space_type) have been added to support these APIs.
