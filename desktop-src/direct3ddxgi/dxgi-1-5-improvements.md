# DXGI 1.5 Improvements

The following functionality has been added to Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) 1.5, to support more flexible specifying and duplication of output formats.

## High Dynamic Range and Wide Color Gamut

Refer to [High Dynamic Range and Wide Color Gamut](high-dynamic-range-and-wide-color-gamut.md).

## Variable refresh rate displays

Refer to [Variable refresh rate displays](variable-refresh-rate-displays.md).

## Duplicating output

A single interface, [**IDXGIOutput5**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_5/nn-dxgi1_5-idxgioutput5), with a single method, [**DuplicateOutput1**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_5/nf-dxgi1_5-idxgioutput5-duplicateoutput1), has been added to DXGI 1.5 to provide a more flexible and higher performance version of the original [**DuplicateOutput**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_2/nf-dxgi1_2-idxgioutput1-duplicateoutput) method. **DuplicateOutput1** allows specifying a list of supported formats for fullscreen surfaces that can be returned by the [**IDXGIOutputDuplication**](/windows/desktop/api/DXGI1_2/nn-dxgi1_2-idxgioutputduplication) object.

## Offering and Reclaiming Resources

Updated methods, [**OfferResources1**](/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_5/nf-dxgi1_5-idxgidevice4-offerresources1) and [**ReclaimResources1**](/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_5/nf-dxgi1_5-idxgidevice4-reclaimresources1), have been added to a new interface, [**IDXGIDevice4**](/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_5/nn-dxgi1_5-idxgidevice4), to allow de-committing of memory in addition to discarding resources. Opting in to the new [**DXGI\_OFFER\_RESOURCE\_FLAG\_ALLOW\_DECOMMIT**](/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_5/ne-dxgi1_5-dxgi_offer_resource_flags) flag means the new reclaim results must be properly handled.
