# Asynchronous DCOM

To take advantage of asynchronous RPC transparently, COM programmers can use the Async\* interfaces generated by the MIDL compiler as described in the MIDL attribute topic, [**async\_uuid**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Midl/async-uuid). For more information, please see [COM Clients and Servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/com/com-clients-and-servers),[Making and Processing Asynchronous Calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/com/making-and-processing-asynchronous-calls), and [Asynchronous Method Calls in COM Clients and Servers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/msdn-magazine-issues).
